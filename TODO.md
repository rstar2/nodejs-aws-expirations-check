# For the Webapp client
1. ~~Use VueMaterial~~

2. Build the app with webpack
	- ~~move DialogAdd to a separate Vue component~~
	- ~~use npm packages and not CDN~~
	- ~~deploy in AWS only the distribution build~~

3. Add authorization/JWT - login/logout (https://cloudly.tech/blog/serverless-authorizers-1/)
	- this means securing the webapp Lambda function with AWS IAM/Cognito

4. ~~Add 'update' item functionality~~

5. Finish the 'cli.js' to request the API-function directly with HTTP requests (using the 'request' module)
