# For the Webapp client
1. ~~Use VueMaterial~~
2. Build the app with webpack
	- ~~move DialogAdd to a separate Vue component~~
	- ~~use npm packages and not CDN~~
	- deploy in AWS only the distribution build
3. Add authorization - login/logout
	- this means securing the webapp Lambda function with AWS IAM/Cognito
4. ~~Add 'update' item functionality~~
